\chapter{Conclusion}
Every of our solutions works fine and are actually build on one another. Through the working process we came to the final conclusion that we would recommend rather the last solution. This one allows to store everything we want and retrieve any data depending on the desired query. It aims for the native language of Redis and can therefore be implemented with any technology around. Its complexity is low. You only need to read the Redis documentation for understanding what we have done. All in all it mirrors our learning progress. This progress does not end with this final solution knowing there are many possibilities provided by Redis (e.g. Lua Script) we did not use.
